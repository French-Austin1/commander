## This is a work in progress

#### Goal
As a devops engineer, I often find myself doing repetitive, one off tasks on
hosts that require one or two simple commands. This is built to be used as a tool
in conjunction with python scripts to accomplish several tasks.

There is a secondary fuctionality as a ssh client that is currently in development.
This can be accessed by not sending in any commands to the cli.
